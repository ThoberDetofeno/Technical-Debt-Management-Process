# Technical Debt Management Process

Technical Debt (TD) is a metaphor that expresses the immaturity of software artifacts and their impacts on maintenance activities and product evolution. As organizations become able to identify and understand the effects of Technical Debt, challenges arise when making investment decisions to pay it off. Although several theoretical and practical studies have been developed recently, studies that adapt the context and stakeholders objectives for Technical Debt Management (TDM) are still lacking.

This article aims to define and implement an incremental and evolutionary process of Technical Debt Management in software development, validated in a real industry application context. This study includes a new process to manage Technical Debt, which can be used to guide the company in the search for better results, periodically reviewing the practices and decisions adopted. The process provides guidelines that can be tailored for other organizations or contexts.
